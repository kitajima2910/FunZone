                                            Dragons in legends are considered animals of heaven, have a higher power
                                            than
                                            other animals. The arrival of the Dragon is conceived to bring goodness,
                                            luck,
                                            convenience and peace. People in the past believed that dragons were
                                            messengers
                                            so that people could send wishes of life such as praying to rain and wind,
                                            praying for food ...
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The dragon is the head animal in the four spirits, the dragon represents the
                                            hexagram Chan, bringing the Yang Qi, the excavation, the will, the fame,
                                            fortune and power. Therefore, on the clothes of kings and royals often
                                            embroidered with golden dragons to represent heavenly beings with supreme
                                            power. The Vietnamese people have a legend about dragons very early because
                                            it is associated with clouds and rain with the long-standing tradition of
                                            growing wet rice, the myth of “The Dragon and the Fairy” and especially
                                            imprinted on the minds of the Ha people. Noi with the names Thang Long, Ha
                                            Long Bay and Mekong River. Not only is the symbol of the origin of the
                                            nation of Vietnam, the dragon is also a god, the owner of the water source,
                                            bringing intense vitality, making the crop good.

                                            Dragons are not actually a real animal, but are a product of imagination,
                                            artistry and strong belief. The dragon's image includes a combination of
                                            species: the snake's body, the lizard's thighs, the eagle's claws, the tail
                                            of the snake, the horns of the deer, the fish scales. It is impossible to
                                            determine exactly why there is such a fully depicted dragon image so there
                                            is a relatively reasonable explanation given that when Hoa Ha unified the
                                            Trung Nguyen tribes that combined the totem mascot. with the mascots of
                                            other tribes forming Giao Long and Rong which were developed based on this
                                            Giao Long image
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Dragons are not real animals but the image of the dragon is depicted in
                                            great detail: snake body, lizard thighs, eagle claws, snake tail, deer
                                            horns, fish scales. Dragon plays an important role for Vietnamese people,
                                            representing the wet rice industry so there are many differences compared to
                                            Chinese dragons.

                                            claws first. Vien Chau symbolizes humanity, intelligence and nobility. The

                                            As the 2nd most famous mascot after the Dragon, folk believe that Lan's
                                            appearance signals goodness and prosperity in the coming. In addition, the
                                            image
                                            of Lan is also used to guard the door of the house, neutralizing the weapon

                                        <p>
                                            Legend has it that Lan was originally a beast from the sea to destroy
                                            material
                                            crops for humans to do business. Therefore Maitreya Buddha transformed into
                                            a
                                            grandfather and tamed a wild animal, turning Lan into a wholesome animal
                                            that
                                            often helps good people, especially filial people, who know how to do good,
                                            so
                                            in addition to the name Lan is also known as a beastman, which means a beast
                                            doing good deeds. Later, in each New Year and mid-autumn festival, Mr. Dia
                                            came
                                            to Lan to dance and entertain people. Mr. Dia and his unicorn went wherever
                                            it
                                            was, so every family rejoiced in hanging green vegetables and red paper to
                                            welcome them. Later, people with money often hang prizes with money tied in
                                            a
                                            red cloth, hanging with cabbage or vegetables.

                                            At the same time, the vitality of the lotus has similarities with the
                                            virtues of
                                            Vietnamese women, who endure hardship, always sacrifice and humility, but
                                            are
                                            also strong and outstanding.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            At the same time, the lotus also shows respect and dignity, which is very
                                            suitable for giving to the mother or woman you respect.
